# angular-portfolio
## First iteration of my angular portfolio
This protfolio is made based off of a tutorial I followed, teaching Angular. 
## I plan to make three versions:

### V1:
**This will be an exact copy of a tutorial, using minimal copy/paste** 

### V2:
**This will be a restyled and rewritten to match my actual qualifications and projects**

### V3:
**This will be a mostly original accurate representation of my work over the past versions**

### V4:
**This will be a near completely original portfolio**
